GTA 3 fixed to run better on hardware at the time of release

At that time, the game received criticism for its high hardware requirements, and although nowadays it seems like meaningless nonsense, I have several reasons why I created this mod:

- I'm a collector of PCs and notebooks, and I like to play on period-correct hardware
- In the past, I tried running the game on the average popular hardware at the time (Pentium 2 ~350mhz, 8MB VRAM) and I discovered that the game would work, but with performance issues that at the time I didn't know how to fix
- When the game was ported to PC, it was done poorly (just like the overwhelming majority of Crapstar game ports), I tried to fix everything I could.

This project is not intended to be a base for you to play on your modern computer. Modern computers are already capable of running the game perfectly, using this mod on modern computers will only make the game uglier.

What this project does:

- Uses many files (mainly texture) from the original version for PlayStation 2 (which has a lower resolution)
- Decreases the size of some textures across the map, which originally did not have enough definition for the resolution they were in (some 128x128 textures just looked like elongated versions of 64x64)
- Careful application of DXT1, DXT5, and palletizing compression methods (see note below)
- Careful Mipmap on many textures (see note below)
- Changing dat files to improve performance
- Removed the 12mb video memory restriction on the executable (requires exe 1.1)
